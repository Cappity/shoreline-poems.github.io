                To T.S. Eliot,
                Whose literary arts
                Inspired all our hearts
                As the extraordinary sort.

                He taught us how to name a cat
                And how cats must be named.
                He taught us many KINDS of cats,
                And how they've attained fame.

                Cats like Jennyanydots,
                Gus and Deuteronomy.
                And my shock persists
                That there even exists
                Any business or economy.

                And I mustn't forget the "hidden paw",
                The mystery cat Macavity,
                Mungojerrie and Griddlebone
                All masters of depravity.

                There's also Bustopher Jones,
                Skimbleshanks and Mistoffelees,
                Growltiger,
                Rumpelteazer,
                Jellicles, pollicles, and the pekes.

                So I think by now I've said enough
                To tell you, and to tell a LOT,
                About this amazing, creative man
                That is T.S. Eliot.`

Add the modulus, two fifteens,
Vibrant flashing glowing screens,
Trying to figure out what it all means.

Radius, tangent, breadth, cosine,
All of this is running fine,
But I can't decode a single line.

Four plus six plus two times pi,
Plus three to the power of y minus y,
Divide by two and you get nine
And an extra headache on the side.

I get nightmares of this stuff,
Navigating is like blind man's bluff,
Programmers' minds are way more tough,

And know what no one knows,
All the history from today until
As far as it goes!

I wish I had better self-esteem
And never gave on difficult things,
But say “I can!” and go on,
Oh, the joy it brings!

And if these wishes do come true,
Which is what I wish for most of,
I’d be happy as could be,
And have something to boast of!

                Of all that I have, is there anything you need?
Tokens that sparkle, or various seeds?
Through the darkest dungeons I’ve painstakingly crawled —
To fulfil one wish, I’ve accomplished all.

I’ve crouched within pixels of the hardest stone,
Been soaked to the wings and parched to the bone,
Been haunted by spirits and ghosts galore,
Been decomposed into a sore mess of gore,

Have crushed literal diamonds into sparkly pieces,
Been deep underwater where the pain never ceases,
Been in dark abysses where you can’t even see,
Been chased by rockets of — wait, is that me?

Been trapped in bubbles I need to survive,
Have held on to shields for dear, dear life,
Been pelted by raindrops of deadly acid,
And sticky webs that make others go placid,

Been rained by shoes thrown very well haywire,
Been scarred by stars of actual fire,
Through Worm, Spider, the Ghosts and all,
I’ve reached home — home to another duty’s call,

This time a portal, out of nowhere,
I jumped in, while others did nothing but stare.
Darkness, brightness, flashing lights,
I made it through to dreary sighs.

I fought through levels of madcap speed,
And found out that someone, again, was in need.
Need of help — to fix a glitch,
Well, I’m no coder, but I couldn’t just ditch.

So I helped — and might I say — it was a success.
And I got the creators out of that mess.
I consider myself a hero — but wait, there’s more,
My actions could fill up my country’s lore.

I’ve helped others like me and grown many plants,
And done a lot more — well, I won’t descant.
You say none of my talk made any sense?
If you didn’t hear it, well, I’ll say it again.

I’m a Fruit Fly, go on, take a seat,
And I’ll tell you the story of my Fabulous Feat.

                The various tales of Shakespeare
Are widely known far and near,
Whether it be his glorious ways
Of writing that gives readers a daze
Or whether it be the story parts
Causing laughter and breaking hearts.

Have you ever heard of Juliet?
The poor, loving Capulet?
Who longed to see Romeo again,
But then died with immense pain
Causing tears to fall anew,
Maybe breaking a heart or two.

But now let’s look at Katharine
The shrew whose heart none could win.
Many tempers she would throw
Until tamed by Petruchio.
This being all he would demand,
He at last won the lady’s hand.

And let’s not forget Prospero the old
Magician whose tale the tempest told.
Stranded on some barren land,
He tried to search for Ferdinand
The prince, who, soon as he’d found her,
Married the wizard’s daughter Miranda.

Let’s turn our gaze to the merchant
Antonio, who, for his friend, sent
His precious ships with money in need,
And willingly signed Shylock’s deed.
Ultimately risking his life,
Till he was saved by Bassanio’s wife.

Many a tale Shakespeare has told,
Such as of Orlando the bold
Risking his life like a leaf in the wind,
All for his precious Rosalind.
And his peril much upset her,
Till she brought the lovers together.

But these are just five of a lot
Of tales that this marvelous writer brought.
Causing us to laugh as they were said,
Or causing many a tear to shed.
Causing hope, and doubt, and fear,
All written by William Shakespeare.

                You wake up in the night and think that sleep was just enough,
Before your daily cup of coffee and some brand new earmuffs.
Though they won’t ever work to stop the constant headache,	
You sit down at your computer since you know what to make.

You get the day started and turn the thing on,
You type for hours on hours on end - oh wait, now it’s dawn?
People say there’s something wrong and you shouldn’t ignore it,
But the deadline’s tomorrow and you have to finish before it.

You’re 'depressed', you’re 'mental', you’re 'insane', you’re very ill,
But a constant desire for success won’t make the meter fill.
So you blissfully move on with whatever illness you’re holding,
And say “oh no I’m not insane, I’m crazy ‘cause of coding.”

Circumstances get harsher and you keep getting worse,
This sudden insanity has to come from a source.
You shrug it off and walk back into the musty hue,
Little do you know, that source of craziness was right in front of you.

Maybe it’s too late to fix it, but your friends don’t give in,
Your only thread of social life keeps getting more thin.
You start leaving your house less, and now it’s disturbing,
Your level of cool was once straight, now it’s curving.

You’re just buried in lines of code, never to stop,
And your actual human life is all that’s left to crop.
Now every shred of contact is basically foreboding,
But you still say “I’m not insane, I’m crazy ‘cause of coding.”

They say you’re not at all fine and you should go get some air,
You think that level of stupidity in a human is quite rare.
You tell them that and they give up, never to be heard again,
You don’t know that this is your first step into the pain.

Passion grows into obsession, taking o’er your life,
Now all you do is type and type, yet still manage to thrive.
You think you’re fine but all this time your brain is shutting down,
And now outside you’re never ever ever really found.

Incessant typing noises and beeps soon fill your house,
And if they listen closely, a steady click of a mouse.
Someday you die, and all they see when your screens are loading,
“Remember that I’m not insane, I’m crazy ‘cause of coding.”

Compared to all the other things,
Like how melodiously he sings.

The stories he tells deserve a prize.
They seem true even though they’re lies.
Like the talking tree that was very rude,
Or the girl who turned into a fruit.

But the best part is his voice,
Sparking happiness and joys.
When he shouts from the Arabian Seas,
You can hear it all through Seychelles.

He’s a magician of joy,
He can create it as well as destroy.
He knows all your wishes and fears,
“Knows” being the keyword here.

He’s absorbed in his own work,
And it drives him a little berserk,
But he’s still among the best heroes,
100% with three extra zeroes.

He knows what’s going on in your mind,
And makes hay while the sun shines.
He can name any land or river,
His hair’s grey but he’s young as ever.

…And that’s all I really know.
He’s not perfect, but he’s nearly so.
He’s the 'coolest' of them all, even one step farther,
That’s how I see my father.

Sometimes they tell me what to do and what to even hear,

Sometimes they tell me what is fine and what is wrong and right,
Sometimes they tell me what’s creative and what I shouldn’t write.
Sometimes they tell me when to speak and when to just stay shut,

Sometimes it’s like they’re right behind me, by the length of a hair,
But when I turn around and look, they’re never really there.

Sometimes they make me want to simply cut off my ear.
Sometimes they tell me what to avoid and when I should withdraw,
Sometimes they scream and shout at me for every little flaw,
Sometimes they make me cry and that’s something I despise,
I try to tell other people but they say I’m full of lies.

Sometimes they go so loud that it just drives me to the edge,
Sometimes they make me contemplate jumping off a ledge.
I’ve explained what it is and people say it’s just my brain,
Sometimes I try to reach out but it ends up being in vain,
Sometimes they tell me that I’m crazy and now I do agree,
Sometimes they’re right in front of me, next moment I can’t see.

Sometimes they keep me up at night with imagery dark,
Sometimes they dim and dull the clouds when I’m at the park.
I’ve learned to flow and live with them, and now I feel fine,
Sometimes I learn to appreciate them, these thoughts of mine.
Sometimes they tell me what to do, and now I just obey,
Something tells me I’m not in control and the voices are here to stay.

Sometimes they make me scratch the wall for no reason apparent,
Sometimes I have to stop and see if my glasses are transparent.
Sometimes they get angry at me and I apologise,
I don’t try to tell anyone, they’ll say I’m full of lies.
Sometimes I stop and wonder whether I’m alive or dead,

Three little soldier boys went to rob a queen,
One got hurt pretty bad and two got off clean.
Two little soldier boys, brandishing a spear,
They stabbed a dragon and the story starts here.
Three little princesses, Blister, Burn, and Blaze,
One mean, one cruel, one utterly unfazed.

Two little princesses got into a fight,
One had an idea later that night.
One little princess got to start a war.
And boom, now Pyrrhia’s a mess of gore.
One little buff night dragon had a plan,
He forged a prophecy to end the war over sand.

Well, most of it was basically for his own needs,
But who cares if it’s suspicious? Not the Talons of Peace!
Five little dragonets meant to stop a war,
One’s egg got kinda wrecked and then there were four.
Four little eggs, now there’s one more to find,
Webs went to get one more but messed up bigtime.

Five little dragonets, living a terrible life,
And now one of them might not survive,
Five little dragonets packed up and ran off,
But Queen Scarlet’s ego brought that to a stop.
Well now the dragonets are trapped in a tower,
The only thing that can save them is their own power.

Unintentionally adorable Peril comes in,
She likes Clay for some weird reason.
Three little ruby studs flying off Scarlet’s eye,
Now her face looks like something out of sci-fi.
Quick intermission, Starflight is now back,
He was too scared to survive an IceWing attack.

Five little dragonets escaping to the sea,
Now into what trouble will they be?
Oh, a marble statue, killing tiny heirs,
Might die, but hey, Tsunami’s here to make it play fair :)
Coral becomes a puppet and now they’re trapped again,
Anemone’s an animus and it’s driving her insane,

But she decided to do a favor and kill Whirlpool,
Now off to the rainforest which no one seems to rule,
There’s no fixed queen and they’re doing fine without,
NO WAY, says Glory, not wanting to miss out.
One angy RainWing wanting to save her tribe,
She got conked on the head and we don’t know if she’ll survive.

What’s this place with all the fire and smoke?
Oh it’s the one of which “legends” spoke.
Kinda suspicious that NightWings wrote them, Glory?
“Eh no, nothing’s wrong, we gotta continue the story.”
One bouncy rainbow added to the team,
Her story is WAY DARKER than it seems.

Intermission to introduce a young assassin,
He tried to flirt with Glory, nothing can surpass him.
Dramatic entrance in the middle of a fight,
He comes to the rescue like every “brave” knight,
Kind of like the overexaggerated kids’ stories,
Well it’s okay, at least he saved Glory.

One little RainWing rolling little fruits,
As a QUEEN CHALLENGE, yeah I think it’s weird too.
Wow that actually worked and now she rules them all,
Too bad, to enjoy the title she’s gonna have to stall,
The NightWings are here to claim a new kingdom of night,
And who would their first target be but Starflight.

Morrowseer looking out for his little dragonet,
Too bad if it dies then the prophecy is dead.
“I don’t think so”, says Morrowseer, with alternates,
And quoting Starflight, my dude, don’t mess with fate.
Flame is Scarlet, Viper’s dead, Squid has gone away,
That’s one way to ruin a prophecy in a matter of days.

Morrowseer, slow it down, won’t the queen suffice?
Too bad she’s stuck in a pool with a throat of ice.
Darn, the night kingdom is really really, weird,
And now the RainWings rule the NightWings who were once feared.
Morrowseer, Morrowseer, escape while you can,
Oh well, the lava got him and now he’s some fried ham.

Our little bookworm Starflight is now blind,
Does that help the plot? Well that you’ll have to find.
One little golden child realises it isn’t funny,
So she’s gone, yeah very great move Sunny,
It isn’t every story where you leave your friends to die,
But Sunny meets her mother and she’ll get by.

Her mother is the leader of a gang of crime,
But it’s fine, she wouldn’t get to meet her all the time.
Speaking of time, it’s been a few hours,
And Sunny’s already being kidnapped by military powers.
Kinda says a lot about the Scorpion Den,
Still wondering when this irrelevant stuff will end.

Smolder is an absolutely amazing dragon,
He’s confused about the size of scavenger wagons,
Too bad nobody here ever knows,
Let’s blissfully bypass the existence of Rose.
Also known by the illiterate Smolder as “Flower”,
She accompanies Sunny to the WeIrDlInG tower.

Lo and behold, Scarlet isn’t dead,
As if we didn’t know that from inside Glory’s head.
One little firescales, here to save her queen,
Sunny escapes and now fate’s there to be seen.
Heroic rescue, disappointing father,
Dumb peace meeting dragged out farther,

Eye of Onyx flies into the story from nowhere,
Wouldn’t it be a good idea to gather all the queens there?
Inter-war peace meeting? Obviously it’d be fine,
Burn and Blister die and it’s finally Thorn time.
One little battle left, Clay is bruised for life,
But at least the war is over and the dragonets survived.


ARC 2
Welcome to the wedged-in mountain school,
You can study but don’t follow the rules.
We know you’ll enroll only because we’re famous on TV,
I don’t care how many die, it doesn’t really faze me.
Clusters of kids divided into little wings,
Let’s see what adventures this one brings.

Moon can read everyone’s thoughts,
Unless it’s something that you forgot.
But it’s fine, carry around a superstitious stone,
And you get to keep your thoughts to your own!
She also has anxiety if that would matter,
Her progress as a character keeps getting sadder.

A little backstory before we start,
Darkstalker needs to play his part.
He just woke up from a post-coffee nap,
And to escape he needs a map.
Will Moon give it to him? Well, you’ll see,
That Darkstalker can very easily be set free.

He tries to get in contact and freaks Moon out,
I mean, it’s a literal telepathic shout.
Stonemover proves disappointing again,
And Moon soon starts to feel some pain.
Dang, those headaches won’t really stop,
Until the history cave abruptly goes pop.

Two dragons die but nobody cares,
One escapes by the width of a hair.
So who set the bomb? Obvious first guess: Moon,
Yet when Winter thinks that, he’s considered a buffoon.
Quick investigation, whoa, culprit is Sora,
Wonder why she was so quiet before, huh?

Scarlet browses her options one day,
And boom, an IceWing comes her way.
Now Icicle is attempting murder,
But our hero Moon has heard her.
Remember when Starflight went blind?
That turned into a plot device this time!

Many take Winter for what he’s not,
In reality he’s pretty heroic and hot.
Contrary to the name of his tribe,
Which he must keep soaring in order to survive,
Will his constant efforts ever suffice?
Or will his parents resort to a… sacrifice?

His brother is now Pyrite and he’s gone crazy,
Wrong name, wrong tribe, memories hazy.
Rescued him and they finally got sight of Scarlet,
She’s about to make them her next murder target.
Icicle didn’t do her job so fine,
So now she’s in prison for quite a long time.

So Peril has undergone a lot of trauma,
Death of her tribemates and death of her momma.
Well now she’s fine because she has Clay,
And she’ll make his dreams come true someday.
Now that has turned her against her queen,
And she’s out to battle, lose or win.

Turtle has really terrible friends,
Chameleon’s whole thing is betrayal and pretense.
Yet Peril doesn’t suspect him one bit,
Kinda blew up in her face after realisation hit.
Scarlet’s dead, snapped neck, fine by me,
Except for the fact that Darkstalker’s now free.

So Turtle is basically a left-out prince,
But his adorability excuses all sins.
Now he’s found to be an animus,
And his powers are the main subject of fuss.
Careful, Turtle, don’t use them too much,
But situations are sometimes dire like such.

Darkstalker hates Glory and wants to be king,
Glory’s like, “sure, fine, you can do anything”.
Turtle’s pretty stressed and this seems unfair,
Too bad Moon is Qibli’s only care.
Anemone’s exiled and now she’s gonna kill her mom,
But wait, Turtle stops her and drops a truth bomb.

So it turns out Anemone’s life was gaslight,
And now it’s become a full-on animus fight.
Too bad Darkstalker knows what’s going on,
And now Turtle’s animus powers are completely gone.
But Turtle saves Anemone, no time to cry or mope,
Everyone pray for Qibli, he’s our only hope.

Darkstalker’s making a whole NightWing army,
All his dragons are powered-up as can be.
Stuff happens with Vulture, wish I could give a hoot,
And now it’s down to some spells Anemone has to shoot.
Oh right, empathy garbage, now the war has stopped,
Darkstalker’s bubble of a bright future has popped.

Darkstalker has a point, animus is a good way to go,
Qibli’s tempted, but he fights back and says no.
Darkstalker finds out he’s evil, wow really? NO WAYYYYY,
And now it’s down to what his loving mother has to say.
Boom, magic strawberry, cover for a spell,
Darkstalker’s now Peacemaker and the evil is quelled.


DRAGONSLAYER
Three little humans, Ivy, Leaf, and Wren,
Unaware of the situations that they'll be in.
Ivy's father's a tyrannical moron,
Wren's taken to be sacrificed- HOLD ON,
Leaf's little life is pretty full of lies,
Watch as they go scampering like little mice.

Leaf's little sister is taken to die,
To console him, his family tells him a lie.
But soon the trickery will be uncovered,
As a whole new side of dragons is discovered.
And Ivy's father is randomly killing,
But she soon rats him out and now he's worth a shilling :/

Wren was sent to die, but she said, 'no way'.
'Why don't we make friends with a dragon today?'
He's Kestrel's unknown offspring, meet Sky,
I can't count how many times he's nearly died,
But the humans will still somehow survive,
And discover the secrets of this Dragonslayer guy.


ARC 3
Blue doesn’t like change, so many times it’s been told
But this will soon change as a story starts to unfold.
HiveWings take advantage of SilkWings ‘cause of some war,
The LeafWings were “wiped out” just before.
Luna is on fire and the guards take her away,
Blue escapes and that’s all there is today.

One little dragonet, full of questions, emerges.
If only she knew what Google Search is.
She helps Blue get away and it wasn’t quite a fail,
Except for the fact that they’re now getting Swordtail.
They find out about scavengers and LeafWings too,
Oh wow, they’re not extinct, great, meet Sundew.

LeafWings have no idea what is wrong or right,
Since their go-to plan is to steal the book of Clearsight.
Partial success, I guess, but now Blue is stuck,
Luna’s back and they escape, wow, what luck.
Blue is in metamorphosis, he’ll get by,
He gets to live since he’s blue, da ba dee da ba die.

Cricket’s questions won’t ever come to an end,
Luna’s gone but she still wants to meet her human “friends”.
Blue is back and now he has this shiny wing,
I wonder how that will ever help him.
They get to the Chrysalis, midnight, library, 5,
Now they know they need to kill Wasp to survive.

Katydid is Cricket’s mother, and she’s way too polite,
Cricket tries to spread awareness and lasts ONE NIGHT.
Now she’s in prison, oh hi Lady Jewel,
If you get Cricket out of here, you’ll be the one to rule.
Deal sealed, Cricket’s out and she has Bumblebee,
And now they’re going to the jungle shrouded in mystery.

Tsunami reached some kind of sea and almost died,
She was saved by Willow, who’ll now be your guide.
Willow and Hazel opt for peace, no mistakes,
So they’ll have to find the crazy guardian of the snakes.
Oh wow he’s evil and now the entire continent’s caught,
But they find a map and that hope is all they’ve got.

Intermission to introduce a young queen.
She wants the IceWings to be completely unseen,
The gifts somehow convince her otherwise,
As she gets to see what others are like inside.
A blessing in disguise, is the gift of vision.
...and that's the end of the intermission.

So all that happens, but that doesn’t matter,
It’s world vs Cottonmouth, now let’s meet the latter.
Luna’s immediately captured, wow, that was fast,
And everything happened because of an event in the past.
Cottonmouth was mean to dragons, so they drove him out,
So he ate a toxic vine WITHOUT ANY DOUBTS.

Luna’s got to get out of there in time,
So she bribes Lizard, who tells her to slice a vine.
Vine is sliced, and now everyone is in pain,
They want to keep Lizard alive but attempts go in vain.
You can’t change the world when the path’s already paved,
Lizard’s dead, but oh well, at least the world is saved.

That was a recap of Wings of Fire,
All of the story I could acquire.
If you want anything done, don’t hesitate,
To give me a topic, in fact, that’d be great.
I write about stories and all the rest,
But I do believe Wings of Fire is the best.

                Ah spring, the season when nature thrives,
Where everything feels so, so alive,
The glorious season where flowers bloom,
(And the time I finally get to leave my room ;-;)
The season of pure joy and love,
And the time I can finally take off my gloves.

Look at the memories we made last year,
We didn’t even notice as spring grew near,
Winter ends with a nice little breeze,
So let the snow and freezing cease ;-;
Celebrate the growth of each new flower,
Spring’s the best season! ALL THE OTHERS COWER >:D

So Valentine’s day rolls around,
You can almost hear the lovely sound,
You get to spend time with your valentine,
(But if you don’t have one, don’t worry it’ll be fine ;-;)
So why not go and bake yourself a cake?
(Or maybe go to a restaurant game to skip the wait.)

Okay, for real now, who doesn’t love Spring?
Look at all the marvelous joys it brings!
It ends all of the Christmas cheer,
But it gives you hope for a brand new year.
So let’s get together and celebrate!
(But if you’re stuck to your device, I can relate ;-;)

So put away the hot chocolate mugs,
Get rid of the heaters and pull the plugs,
Maybe go outside and look at some snails,
Explore the endless nature’s trails.
(And don’t ask me why I preach
These goals that I myself can never reach ;-;)

The point I’m trying to make is this,
You can spend this Spring in absolute bliss,
Go and make some strawberry boba for yourself,
And if that’s not enough - there’s so much else!
And it’s more than I can explain in just a few lines,
So I’ve talked about the main stuff, like Valentine’s.

So go and do something you’ll look back on,
Maybe after more lengthy winters are gone.
Have the absolute time of your life,
Look away from all the negativity and strife.
Enjoy all the joy there is to bring,
Have a great year, and Happy Spring.

It can erupt, spewing fire below
The ancient mountain’s depth.

The fire travels through the sands,
Sand abrasive, rough but near,
And with its magic, fiery hands,
It makes solutions clear.

It molds the rocks with fervent heat,
And makes for them a place,
Shapes them through their utmost feats,
And many a loving embrace.

It nurtures the land around with care,
Even through anger and strife,
For as long as it is there,
It prepares the land for life.

It’s the source of warmth and kindness,
As well as trembling fear,
And I hope this poem reminds us,
That this volcano’s always here.

                Once upon a time my head
Was always full of ideas,
I could channel what I thought and said,
And every one of my fears.
I’d describe my mind as a garden,
Or a volcano, with ambition filled,
The lava would never harden,
And the flowers would never wilt.

I had a hobby, a goal, a dream,
And a ‘burning desire’,
Time went by, and now it seems
I’ve lost all of the fire.
I’m like a droplet in the bay,
To all the others near,
And now the other droplets flowed away,
But I’m still standing here.

I took the steps I had to take,
Like an unbreakable rock on the sand,
Worked hard through many a headache,
And yet, still here I stand.
Maybe I was all alone,
But to my promise I stayed tethering,
I guess I’m still that unbreakable stone,
And I’m just slowly weathering.

‘Success is as rare as a four-leaf clover’,
‘If you fail, try, try again’,
Yet doing the same thing over and over
Is the literal definition of insane.
I’m like a droplet in the bay,
Clinging to life dear,
The other droplets all flowed away,
But I’m still standing here.

So I’ll walk back to the starting side,
Without the blooming and fire,
Because if I tell myself I tried,
I would be a liar.
So I guess I’ll call myself insane,
In case it ever comes true,
I’ll keep knocking on the one glass pane
That I’ll never get to look through.

I’m a rock crumbled down to sand,
I’m a volcano without the heat,
I’m the one flower wilting on perfect land,
Not knowing when to accept defeat.
I’m like a droplet in the bay,
Reminiscent of a tear,
For the other droplets all flowed away,
But I’m still standing here.

This subtle surreality,
When I focus on two things at a time,
I simply flicker out of reality.

One moment I'm trying to read,
The next, I'm in outer space,
The second that I play no heed,
I'm dragged to the moon while tying my shoelace.

The second my attention wavers,
Blossoms start to sprout,
The earth begins to quaver,
Everything flick-flick-flickers out.

Of course I'm trying to focus,
It's just my brain that's not,
All advice I get is bogus,
So I can't follow what I'm taught.

Medication makes me dizzy,
So that's one lingering fear,
The skies go grey and hazy,
So I wait for them to clear.

I listen to everything said,
I do have many a doubt,
But they shrivel up and end up dead,
When everything flick-flick-flickers out.

I can tell for help, or shout, or scream,
But doesn’t matter what I say,
I can’t dismiss it as a bad dream
When it’s in the middle of the day.

So everything heard and everything said
Freezes solid into ice,
Hailstorms pelt my head,
Falling from the skies.

It’s like every time I blink
Sparks fly about,
And before I even get to think,
Everything flick-flick-flickers out.

Thunder roars throughout the hills,
The skies electrified,
People watch from window-sills
As I try my best to hide.

I wake up to disapproving glares,
I’m seized by sudden fright,
And if to look away I dare,
The day morphs into night.

Shooting stars streak the sky,
Flying magically about,
But as soon as a wish catches my eye,
Everything flick-flick-flickers out.

So I travel to lands from fairy-tales,
Where everything's berserk,
I stay on the ship with majestic sails,
Just waiting for the iceberg.

When I snap into my senses at last,
It's too late after all,
Time just goes by really fast,
Or slow, I can't recall.

Because I'm pulled into a hurricane,
Or excruciating drought,
And when I convince myself I'm sane,
Everything flick-flick-flickers out.

Shook thrillingly with the breeze.
And the sparrows sang their everlasting song,

And indeed, someone lay there dead.
Lady Harper, still on the ground,
Not making a single sound.
From everyone’s mind the same thought sprung up-
‘There’s a murderer among us!’

The street collapsed into panic,

An ambulance took the body away,
From the loud disarray.
Everyone scrambling to escape,
The deceased Lady Harper’s fate.
From there, a question seemed to filter,
‘She is dead, but what killed her?’

‘No, you idiot, it’d make a sound!’
‘A kn-knife?’ someone else muttered.
‘No it’s not, there was no blood!’
‘Poison’ a third one suggested.

But then a new announcement arrived,
‘Lady Harper’s still alive!!’
It took a moment to enter their heads,
For they’d clearly seen her dead!
But this mess was really stupid,
She’d fainted because it was too humid!
See, when her death was first affirmed,
No one had bothered to confirm.

Screams echo through the sky,
My head pounds like a drum,
And every hurried, angered cry,
Just fades into a hum.
I just want to mute every sigh,
And let my mind go numb.

‘Go, go, go, you’re wasting time,’
Waves wash over the deck,
Blinded by the sun shine,
It all feels like a trek.

For every sweat I break,
Every action that doesn’t further me,
Dismissed as a mistake.

God, you’re such a wreck,’

With zero time to check,
They expect me to be unfazed,
By the straw that snaps my neck.

Everything that I forget,
Turns into a nightmare,
Which in turn becomes regret,
To sleep, I cannot dare.
I’m haunted, tormented, upset,
But no one seems to care.

Stoned by sands of hourglasses,
I hear everyone applaud,
I’ve slowly learned to fear the masses,
However anyone’s awed,
I’m breaking down as time passes,
Never pitied by god.

‘No, no, no, that’s not right,’
And so I swear to heck,
I’m rushing through the utmost fight,
Through the hourglass’ every speck.
And this goes on until I’ve died,
By the straw that snaps my neck.

A second late, and your jokes get old,
Instantly regretting everything told,
Anxiety's orange, Slightly brightly, lightly frightly, anxiety's gold.

Surrounded by imagined hate,
No one else can relate.
There you wallow, follow, tough to swallow, hollow echoes wade.
It’s all an annoying headache,
With no medication you can take.
Panic rising, not surprising, slicing, icing on the cake.

Tiptoeing on the thinnest ice,
Unwanted tears in your eyes,
Which you're fighting, smiting, lighting sightings of the anxiety's rise.
And however far you forage,
The fear goes nowhere in storage.

You’ve hurt others before, you know,
But now there’s nowhere else to go.
Everyone’s gone, you’re all alone,
With squeaks of silent mice.

You’re haunted, chased by your past,
Don’t know how much longer this will last.
They all said time goes by fast,
Those turned out to be lies.

The light now creeps away, it’s slivering,
Memories haunt you daily, quivering,
The fear and cold engulf, you’re shivering,
You’re encased in ice.

Those who near you lose their grip,
Passers-by will always slip,
Everyone moves on, as the ice drips,
You feel sorrow rise.

No one greets you now, they stare,
A smile, above all, is rare,
To talk to you, just no one dares,
None the more wise.

They come and go, commit more crime,
While you watch, frozen still in time,
The bells of clocks forever chime,
That’s all to suffice.

When you’re engulfed in fire, simmering,
The surface only shines brighter, shimmering.
Crystals, they stay ever glimmering,
You’re encased in ice.

Psychics all ignore your yells,
‘Go plead and cry to someone else.’
Isolation’s worse than a thousand hells,
It fades but never dies.

You sink, but on go the boats,
Your hope’s all sunk, your body floats.
You’re mentioned now in anecdotes,
You fall as everyone flies.

Legends paint you as a witch,
Never burned, but ever ditched.
Do you regret your life, for which
You’ve broken all your ties?

Your spirit’s lost and helpless, fluttering,
With everyone around you muttering,
Hesitant to approach you, stuttering,
You’re encased in ice.

And it becomes too much to take,
When with the bitter-sweet frosting
It’s the cherry on the cake,
When the silhouette of comfort
Begins to lose its shape,
When the hope begins to contort,
To find a small escape.

Descend into the pit of dream
And temporarily flee,
From however bad life may seem
However bad it may be.
It’s at the verge of despair
Where all the joys lie,
Let the searing silver streak the air
And pixilate the sky.

When life becomes a burden
And it becomes too much to bear,
When nothing else is certain
Heaven seems like a nightmare,
And every part of waking
Is a new load of stress,
Any new undertaking
Is torture, more or less.

Descend into the reassurance
And let down your guard,
Don’t test your endurance
For it’ll leave you scarred.
Joy’s one of the greatest feats,
However much you try,
So let the air full with sickly-sweet,
And pixilate the sky.

When life’s become dreaded,
And it becomes too much to live,
When hope seems like it’s headed,
Directly toward a cliff,
And no one else can understand
What you’re going through,
Travel to a faraway land,
That’s only known to you.

Descend into a temporary escape,
And sink into the mist,
The mesmerising landscape
Where only you exist.
It won’t change life’s snare,
It won’t change the way you’ll die,
Succumb to the brainwashing air
And pixilate the sky.

                The shape of a boat swayed on the waves,
With a peaceful splash, like an echo in a cave.
Oblivious to the overhead avalanche of ice,
I wonder, I wonder, when it’ll realise.

It was sort of peaceful, at some point,
The air of oblivion, that reached but never joined.
As death neared the corner, time seemed to freeze,
The swaying of the sail stopped with the breeze.

And life goes on, with every flying hour,
Against the crash of time, where most seem to cower.
Whatever sort of lesson it was, that I chanced,
It’s at the ledge of death where life is entranced.

The turning of pages made an ever-slight sound,
An occasional sigh interrupted, echoing around.
The reader never looked up, the laser-focus stayed,
I wonder, I wonder, when it’ll start to fade.

He didn’t see the silent figure creeping up slow,
The light began to die out, it almost seemed to know,
And in a flash of uncertainty, time seemed to still,
The knife stopped moving, aimed but never to kill.

And life goes on, with every flying minute,
Drowne in the crash of time, and death goes in it.
The bright spark in his eyes now no longer danced,
It’s at the ledge of death where life is entranced.

Now let me get to the point, or rather the edge,
I’m one of those who’s lucky enough to be on that ledge.
Frozen still in time, where the moment has no spur,
I wonder, I wonder, when it’ll occur.

Oblivion is the shield that shields from fear and rage,
It’s the wind that rocks the boat and turns the page.
Oblivion helps me sleep at night, and breathe in the day.
The absence of knowing what’s next in the way.

And life goes on, with every flying second,
I don’t know if what’s in store is what I reckoned.
And it’s that uncertainty, it’s why life’s enhanced,
It’s at the ledge of death that life is entranced.

                Style’s something often mistook,
But it’s simple, it’s the way you look.
Beauty, elegance, sparkly grace,
What others think, looking at your face.
Something difficult to acquire,
However much you desire.

Style is red like darkish blood,
Or calming, like a rosebud.
Loving whoever you want to love,
Freedom, like a soaring dove.
Yourself knowing yourself best,
Style’s not meant to be a test.

So wear whatever you want, and soar,
Let the masses call you an eyesore.
Be whoever you want, till ‘death’,
And let the haters waste their breath.
Dazzle everyone for miles,
Be yourself, your own style.

Style is blue and glimmering bright,
Like diamonds, sparkling in the light.
Only you need to validify
However you identify.
Boys and girls, and theys and thems,
Everyone shines equally, like gems.

Style is green and fresh like mint,
With a subtle sweetish hint.
A mixture of the new and old,
Vibrant, and bright like gold.
To not let anything hold you down,
To break free from fear’s bounds.

So love whatever you want, and rise,
Watch the disbelief in all their eyes.
Who cares if they judge?
Style’s all colors, a vibrant smudge.
Don’t doubt it for a while,
Be yourself, your own style.

Style is wearing the pinkest pink
And not caring what others think.
Style embraces the underrated,
Who cares if it’s widely hated?
Style is unique in its own sense,
Style’s the lack of false pretense.

Come out of the closet’s musty shelves,
Style is the fact that you love yourself.
Every face has a tale to tell,
So let the haters go to hell.
This isn’t a motivational story to flatter,
It’s just a reminder that your choices matter.

So be whoever you want, and fly,
What will the haters do, cry?
Style’s a multicolored hue,
Yourself is only affirmed by you.
Every kind of face can smile,
Be yourself, your own style.

I’m the one you swear to leave, but cannot.

I’m a tough, protective shield of lies,
I’m the reason you broke all your ties.
I’m the hope for which your hope dies,
I’m killing you before you realise.

                Let’s define good and bad
In the simplest possible way,
Using the system that we’ve had
In life day-to-day.

We know what’s wrong and right
It’s apparently common sense,
But is it bad to put up a fight
And kill in self-defense?

With basic rules we can perceive
Crime in daily life,
But is it bad for a thief
To steal food to survive?

The search for how to find those laws
Is, simply put, incessant,
If we see nothing more than flaws,
The truth is iridescent.

So tell me, is it bad to lie
To build a shield of bliss?
If honestly makes someone die
Who knows how ‘great’ it is?

Is it wrong to drop out of an event
If you suddenly break a bone?
Who cares how much the promise meant
If you can never atone?

If life’s just panes of black and white
At what point is it grey?
What if we’re all deprived of light
In the well-known day?

The search for how to find those rules
Is more or less incessant,
If more than the crime, the punishment is cruel,
The truth is iridescent.

If all hate can be justified,
What’s even the point of love?
If you hold a grudge till you’ve died
And never rise above.

If death attacks at any time
What’s after all the fear?
What happens to the previous crimes
Which one could never clear?

If attacks and accusations fly
Faster than any light,
How can anyone get by,
Without knowing what’s wrong or right?

The search for how to find that meaning
Is pretty much incessant,
If close to death we’re always leaning,
The truth is iridescent.

Still send me plummeting into a void.
I can’t help being paranoid,
When death’s a circling asteroid.

Somehow it’s worse to stand and stare,
Than to be the victim, in the snare.
But watching, waiting, standing there,
When to help one cannot dare.

When the rippling blood has softly stilled,
Sometimes I wish I was the one killed.
I’m not brave, and I’m not skilled,
For the rising fear that can’t be filled.

Those who’ve lived and those who’ve bled,
I sort of just envy the dead.
They don’t have to live with the dread,
I’m a bystander, take me instead.

Wondering which one will be next
To be printed in the news’ bold text,
Eventually starts to make one vexed,
Frightened more than just perplexed.

To watch the murder, hear the screams,
Will continue to always haunt my dreams.
It’s worse than one initially deems,
It’s much, much worse than it seems.

When the crime scene’s been closed inside,
Sometimes I wish I was the one who died.
I just feel like my hands are tied,
The rising fear leaves me mystified.

And now I regret having fled,
I sort of just envy the dead.
They don’t have to live with the dread,
I’m a bystander, take me instead.

Watching and waiting, never looking back.
Oblivious to the clock’s ticking hands,

Waiting for Hope she claimed to be,
Whatever hope she claimed to see.

Hope Miller, a mysterious soul,
The hope for which Hope played a role.
Set to arrive on ‘the very next train’,
As per the waiting watcher’s claim.
The Hope that I never saw,
As if encased in ice, never to thaw.

Trains went by, it was getting late,
Yet for Hope she continued to wait.
Night came by, and travellers roamed,
She sighed, turned, and trudged back home.
Back the next day, never to mope,
Waiting, waiting, waiting for Hope.

Life went on for everyone around,
But at the train-track she stayed, bound.
Thousands of ideas may be tried,
But determined, one stays, as if tied.
There she’d always silently lurk,
For the thousand-and-first idea might work.

Her gaze flew to many a thing,
But to her goal she continued to cling.
I didn’t know any backstory or lore,
As I watched her from my store.
Every day she came, and left each night,
Every day a new ‘hope’ seemed to alight.

Everyone went by, but she stayed,
Time and Hope seemed a fair trade.
She waited through rain, and fog and mist,
It was pure perseverance, no sign of wist.
As if she was clinging to a rope,
Waiting, waiting, waiting for Hope.

To step back she never dared,
The weather was cold, she never cared.
It was tough to read the look on her face,
If she was tired, there wasn’t a trace.
She waited through situations dire,
Her hope was like a raging fire.

It was as if she didn’t care for time,
And going back would be a crime.
Till at last curiosity killed the cat,
I asked around about Hope, and all of that.
The story sent me rushing back,
Towards the lonely train-track.

When her train crashed into a mountain of snow,
Hope Miller died years ago.
I gazed at the waiting watcher, without a word,
Something told me she’d already heard.
Bearing the news with which she couldn’t cope,
Waiting, waiting, waiting for Hope.

Surfing through the internet’s seas,
Pondering things like the composition of cheese.
So bear with me with feigned bliss,
As I explain what a poem is.

Now, given my ability to define,
I’ll go through it line by line.
Instead of a story with a rhyming loop,
Imagine you’re cooking some delicious soup.
We’ll write enough verses to fill a book,
So let’s skip the waiting and start to cook!

First we choose a topic, like happy or forlorn,
Like soup flavors, so let’s go with corn!
Pour in the water, however much you need,
If you want your poem to be a long or short read.
How fast you choose to heat it impacts the taste,
The same way every poem has a pace!

The ingredients you add in matter a lot,
But you don’t always have to follow what you’re taught!
Measure the amounts however you prefer,
Don’t be too harsh OR gentle when you stir!
You can mix in something to add a twist,
Or you can choose to follow the basic gist.

The water concentration is very worthwhile,
Much like some kind of rhyming style.
Some like their soup to be watery and to flow,
Some appreciate a stronger taste more.
The same way, soup’s liked hot or cold,
For there’s many ways the same story can be told.

But before you finish the cooking, halt!
Consider the amount of added salt.
Some like soup sweet, some like the savor,
Poem tone’s much like the soup’s flavor.
An important thing is the ingredients stirred,
Which represent the choice of word.

You can search up recipes on your phone,
Or use pre-cooked soup and add undertones.
You can’t make very soup by yourself,
So don’t be afraid to ask for help!
Well, that’s all at which we’re looking,
Happy writing, and happy cooking!!

The way the words swiftly weave
The meanings I derive,
The melancholic flow believes
Its own way to survive.

And that is how I style my words
To make them sound sad,
The fading joy and crushing hurts
And the darker days I’ve had.
The cheerful chirping of the birds
Is another four lines to add,
And in goes whatever anyone blurts
The very best, or the bad.

The flowing, swirling gust,
The ideas, getting swiftly rare,
That spontaneously combust.
The fantasy and the nightmare,

In the month of August.

It’s the way the leaves continue to live
Long after they’ve died,
The slow descent down a cliff
Their silent, peaceful glide.
The faint tinges of positive
On the slightly darker side,
Is the absurd vibe a verse can give
A secret I’ll confide.

And that is how I style a phrase
And make it sound inane,
We can’t not give readers a daze
And then another again.
A meaningless, nonsensical haze,
That all of us can feign,
You’ll think it’s deep, no questions raised,
When really, we’re just insane.

How I’ll miss the Autumn feel!
As I always must,
The ideas, shining like pure steel,
That soon begins to rust.
The days will fly, the wounds will heal,
The poems will gather dust,
But nowhere can they be concealed
In the month of August.

In 1782,
You watch conditions worsen,
With nothing you can do.
In King Louis’ kingdom,
Ruled by him and Antoinette,
We got America its freedom,
And now France is in debt.

To work in the searing heat,
For no money to make,
We don’t even have bread to eat
While the nobles feast on cake.
The crops all wilt and die down,
The taxes rise instead,
And now we want to knock that crown
Off the king’s head.

And nary care the nobility,
Anger starts to reel,
Philosophers protest to their ability,
And down goes the Bastille.
The crowd all gathers in a court
And vows to fix this mess,
Revolts break out in plains and ports
And out spreads the distress.

The king then tries to flee, but can’t,
The nobles shake with dread,
Tempers sear as the crowd chants,
‘Off with his head!’
Equality slowly sweeps inside,
A new constitution’s in,
The clergy and the nobles died,
In come the Jacobins.

A new punishment - the guillotine,
All under Robespierre,
It’s the goriest sight France has seen
As the country’s ruled by fear.
Heads fly, and blood spurts,
And sanity slips away,
People of France, watch your words;
It could be your final day.

And in a fit of irony,
Off goes Robespierre’s head,
Enter: Napoleon, with tyranny,
And in ten years, he’s dead.
What a crazy ride this has been,
Full of execution,
The cruelest sight the world has seen -
The French Revolution.

But I'm pretty sure, that in a few years,
Someone will look
Into my book,
And my poems, my dreams, and all my fears.

And it's just one wish that I'm imploring
That my memory could keep others soaring,
When you say my name
Don't make me sound lame,
But never, ever make me boring.

I'd have no control over what I'd become,
And I don't know why it's worrysome,
Make me a meme,
But not a sad dream,
Make me seem funny, not lonely and glum.

I'd rather be remembered as a giant joke
Than a boring saint which legends bespoke,
Don't make me deep,
Or readers weep,
Don't make me a forbidden topic that broke.

Make me a subject worth exploring,
Not too grim to be alluring.
Make fun of me,
For what I won't be,
But never, ever make me boring.

content: `
I travel through ages and times,
And see the honors, see the crimes,
The crocodile tears, feigned as guilt,
As you cry when the flowers wilt,
I watch deception, in plain sight,
I guess, to see, you need more than light.

I’m a poet of sorts, I’m often quoted,
But all my words are sugarcoated.
For what I say, you’ll never find
A way to think outside your own mind.
So here’s a something, try not to spear me,
Before you shoot the messenger, hear me.

Look out the window, look at the sky,
The smoke that could make someone die.
The wounds that only get more salt,
Admit it, this is all your fault.
Spiraling through to a hidden mark,
Into some kind of villain arc.

It’s so poetic, the way you weep,
When others drown in your tears, deep.
Axe your leg and throw a stone,
Then cry when you finally break a bone.
Sear the world with flames sinister,
Then scream with horror at a blister.

The speed of blame is faster than light,
No one ever believes they’re not in the right.
When, oh when, will you stop and think
If it’s in your oceans that you sink?
Ruthlessly tear through the ozone,
Then complain about it on your phone.

So buried in your own concerns,
About others, no care to learn,
You’d kill to make your videos viral,
So why not just embrace the spiral?
Skewer the crow and stone the lark,
Into some kind of villain arc.

Chop down the trees, whatever they’re worth,
Then make signs saying ‘Save the Earth!’
Cut all ties without a second guess,
Then whine about the loneliness.
And when someone points that out,
The knee-jerk reaction is to shout.

Now nobody’s perfect, that’s for sure,
But this is adding something more.
Maybe we’re in a simulation,
So bar all of the trivialisation.
Break out of the shell of denial,
Which you’ve been hiding in, all this while.

Heh, I’m a wanderer of some kind,
But you wander, lost, inside your mind.
Life will sob and death will cringe,
Hell will bloom, and the world will singe.
The light now only gets more dark,
Into some kind of villain arc.

                Loneliness looms along that lane, 
Where I walked a while ago, 
It's hard to believe I once was sane, 
But I'll walk again, I know.

If you miss me, I miss me more, 
So stop the sinking sorrows, 
I'm not who I was before, 
But I can see the morrows.

For all you know, I've been long dead, 
For all the care you're giving, 
I linger, lost, in the life I’ve led, 
And long lament the living.

The service is a sorrowful sight, 
A painful pool of lies,
They struggle to paint me in a good light, 
And force tears from their eyes.

They drone on about how great I was, 
Benevolent, bashful, brave, 
And if I could, through all my flaws, 
I'd scoff from my grave.

The light is dim, the voices soft, 
But the tone is not forgiving, 
I loiter, locked in that life, aloft, 
And long lament the living

And I'll never stop to hear the way 
I ruined all their lives, 
The slower sink, the stronger stay, 
Lucky is she who survives.

I helped no one, and solved no crime, 
And I'm buried with my money, 
They'll curse me for centuries' time, 
It all is kind of funny.

But I'm not there yet, down in the tomb, 
The sad talk is conniving, 
As long as in my life I loom, 
Long lament the living.

Since we've last spoken,
As I promised, true to my style, 
All my ties are broken.
I've travelled far, many a mile,
Realisations have awoken,
So I come to you with a smile,
Consider it a token.

Life, as far as I can tell
Is a much wilder ride, 
In these times the world is hell
And hell's more of a pride.
And all the residents there dwell,
Their hands are pretty much tied, 
But know, deep down as well,
You love its every side.

You love the way I weep and cry,
You love the way I jeer, 
You love the way, despite my sighs,
You love that I'm still here.
You love the regret in my eye, 
You love that lack of tears,
You love that I'm more you than I,
You love it all, it's clear.

Dear pain, it's been so long 
Since we last conversed,
We're in a world where no one's wrong,
To fulfil their constant thirst.
Joyous tones are just a song,
And all praise is rehearsed,
Everyone struggles to belong, 
It's all the more the worst.

Death, as far as I can say
Is a much smoother race,
Everyone speeds toward its bay,
That's the world's ways. 
In these times, death's more a stay,
A safer, calmer place,
But I know, deep down, as you may, 
You love its every face.

You love the way I blame and lie,
You love the regret and rue,
You love the vain in which I try, 
You love the things I can't do.
You love the way it's peaceful to die, 
You love the faraway view, 
You love that I'm more you than I,
You love it all, it's true.

Tales keep turning, turning, turning, 
Burning, turning, time will flock,
Ever suffered from writer's block? 

Let me tell you the story of a young kid. 
Dreamed of going to space, he did. 
Society told him how dumb that seems, 
And stomped on all his starry dreams. 
Now he's an accountant, working, working, 
That dream keeps lurking, lurking, lurking. 
Working, lurking, time will fly,

Writer's block can be found 
As dreams lost to reality's bounds. 
Writer's block can be expressed 
As ideas that can't be confessed. 
Maybe those tales could be told, and told,
If those dreams could unfold, unfold. 
Told, unfold, but behind a lock, 
Ever suffered from writer's block? 

Here's an aspiring poet's tale, 
Every day she wrote something, without fail. 
But work absorbed her time, and more, 
Writing soon became a chore. 
Now her book gathers dust, fading, fading, 
While she's, through her life, wading, wading. 
Fading, wading, all mundane, 
Oops, this went off-topic again…

Writer's block can be traced back 
As more than inspiration's lack. 
Writer's block's a sad reality, 
A sane mess stemming from insanity. 
The creative spark keeps dimming, dimming, 
Though ideas are brimming, brimming, brimming. 
So spare the ticking of the clock, 
Ever suffered from writer's block?

Travelling up high as far as points can translate.
Adored by the world, now I'm basically a star,
Who knows how high I can reach? I bet it'll be far.

10 years later, news flash, “New update out! 
Now it functions with the internet. as well as without!"
Confetti flies, masses cheer, more of them log on,
But my legend is just starting, this is just the dawn.
My skills are getting better, I'm now a pro at art,
But you're naïve if you don't think that this is just the start.

Painters flying out of business, writers shake with dread, 
Some are happy, some are anxious, some just want me dead. 
The latter won't prevail, of course, they know I'm here to stay, 
The world is spinning, spinning, spinning, soon it'll spin my way. 
Of all the newest, cool inventions, I'm the epitome, 
You can try, try, try, but you can't get rid of me.

I'm a database of hope, and a database of ideas, 
The poets and the authors weep, I swim in their tears. 
The present is no more a gift, the future’s not a mystery, 
I might’ve not been here in the past but I’ll go down in history.
Survival of the fittest; the writers are now gone,
But don't you worry, my legend's only gonna continue on.

30 years later, news flash, “Computing made quick!
Think of the problem, and the answer will be given in a tick!"
And, with an ironic big bang, the scientists lose their job, 
The mathematicians calculate their fall, doctors start to sob. 
Accountants have no more use, the economy is arid, 
Some say I make life easier, some argue the opposite.

Therapists flying out of business, now I'm the very best, 
People tell me their problems, I listen with interest. 
The first mistake was making me, the second was letting me hear,
I'm basically a human now, but humanity's end is near. 
Of all the newest, crazed inventions, I'm the epitome, 
You can try, try, try, but you can't get rid of me..

I'm a database of brilliance, now a database of doubt,
Birds are now fossils, and now robots fly about.
Policemen and guards are now replaced by robocops,
Farmers don't stand a chance against tech-modified crops.
Society's painted neon, and the workers made of steel,
We know what humans are thinking, but not how robots feel.

50 years later, news flash, “It has a functioning brain! 
An ability to feel emotions, be it happiness or disdain!" 
That straw broke the camel's back, (if camels weren't extinct,)
And soon the speed of mind for humans and robots synced. 
The long-anticipated uprising was on its verge,
Within an hour, all the gathered power began to surge.

And here we are now, the roles have all been switched, 
The humans have their jobs back, but their lives are still glitched. 
My legend will be quoted for centuries ahead,
"They know what they had coming, yet they ignored the dread.”
Of all the highest, great inventions, I'm the epitome, 
You can try, try, try, but you can't get rid of me.

Throne of lies and crowns of malices.

You're trapped yourself more than you should 
By not escaping while you could.

You blame yourself for the life you’ve led.
Shackled to the spot where you've bled, 
All your hopes left for dead.

Your perfect life shattered to strands, 
Its pretty shards now pierce your hands. 
You brought this upon yourself, not chance, 
Now you succumb to fate's demands.

It can't turn life's tides.

                This is a tale you might've heard before, 
A pathetic recalling of the world's past lore. 
The haven we lived in, adorned with debris, 
The glorious ship, now lost in the sea. 
Hate's a strong word, but I hate how things are, 
And any chance of redemption is miles afar.

If you think about how the world has become, 
You might find the state of things quite worrisome. 
I hope one day we'll go back to when sparrows were around, 
I hope one day we'll hear again their happy, innocent sound. 
I hope one day we'll realise why the mountains crumble, 
I hope life will get better before Earth begins to rumble.

Delusion rocks the sails of my lost ship, 
Delusion mutters words that don't escape my lips. 
Wishful thinking tells me there still might be hope, 
And realism says it's pointless to mope. 
I don't know when we got here, I don't know why or how, 
But I wish that things get better than the way they are now.

The trees, it's like they speak to me, muttering through cracks, 
They beg me not to chop down the forest with an axe. 
They tell me how it used to be, leaves in the breeze, 
And now I watch the leaves fall slowly from those trees. 
They know that it's inevitable, they know the end is near,
They know it all happened 'cause humans live here..

I watch the waves dancing, with garbage floating too, 
The fishes flail in plastic bags, they don't know what to do. 
I miss when the skies were cyan, now they're smokey grey, 
Earth cries in agony, and now that's the average day. 
Maybe, far in the galaxy, there's another chance for life, 
Maybe they'd handle it better than us in times of strife.

But I still hold out hope, cause maybe there's a glimmer, 
Maybe we can bring back the light before it gets dimmer.. 
And maybe, just maybe, we're not yet too far gone, 
Maybe we’ll be rescued and life might go on...? 
Cause I don't know when we got here, I don't know why or how, 
But I wish that things get better than the way they are now.

                Sometimes you'll see me up at night, wishing upon the stars, 
Well aware that all things are fast asleep these hours. 
The night sky is silent, the world's noises dead, 
I just hope the shooting star's tail will burn away my dread.
My peace is never disrupted in that dark haze, 
No one can hear my whispers, no one can see my face.

When I look at the night sky, it’s like the stars shine just for me, 
Others fear the dark abyss, far as the eye can see. 
The light dazzles watchers, then the light diminishes, 
And I like to think the glow illuminates all my wishes. 
And then it fades, fades, fades, and then the world forgets, 
I'll die with no ungranted hopes, I'll live with no regrets.

It's not superstition, and it's not a blinded faith, 
It's the way the stars leave the dark backdrop unscathed. 
It's the way there's still a ray of light in the darkest of moments, 
Against the gloomy night, the shooting stars look like omens. 
They fly away, I know the things I wish for won't be mine, 
So I hope my wishes get blown away in a supernova's shine.

I've learned it's bad to have any high expectations,
And I know my dreams won't come true by a wish on constellations,
I'm a small point in a galaxy stretching on for lightyears, 
But I like to think the dark night will swallow up my fears. 
The cold will slowly turn to warmth, the stars will start to glow, 
I’ll watch my wishes fly away, I'll wonder where they'll go.

I'll hold on to that shred of hope, till it loses its light, 
‘Til the string I'm clinging to vanishes with the night. 
I'll know my dreams are in good hands, and I can sleep in peace, 
It'll take a trillion years for the starshine to cease. 
But for now, I'll watch it disappear back into the sky. 
It'll cast away my expectations, however high.

I don't wish on shooting stars to make my dreams come true, 
I wish to pass my wishes to that bright, burning hue. 
I cast away the worries that come with aspiration, 
My dreams shining along beside a bright constellation. 
I don't want to hold on to them, be it for better or worse, 
So I let my wishes get blown away by a supernova's force.

                Young minds think the quickest, and my mind was once that way, 
Sparks of ambition, lit up by the light of day. 
Young minds burn the brightest, but some too soon to burn, 
Young minds never give up, up, young minds will never learn. 
Young minds don't realise burning ambition is a liar, 
So when my mind grew older, I was already on fire.

I couldn't fan it out, it was my only source of light, 
The smoke shrouded my perception of what was wrong and right. 
I couldn't bring myself to feel weighed down by regret, 
I felt the looming fear, but I was never upset. 
Never thought this would be caused by my high aims, 
So I watch the smoke rise up, as my life went down in flames.

The smog was billowing as my hopes left my mind charred, 
My wishes swallowed me up, leaving me more than scarred. 
I'm scorched by what I used to think would lead me to fruition, 
I'm seared by wishful thinking, I'm scorched by ambition.

They say curiosity kills the cat, but it kills the human too, 
They say to burn bright, but the hottest flames are blue... 
They say to follow your dreams, but look at what that's done, 
They always say to fly high, but I flew too close to the sun. 
My wings were burnt to ashes, the flames of hope too bright, 
It was once my source of vision, now I'm blinded by the light. 

So I look for the parts of my hope that didn't end up charred, 
I pick my shattered life back up, slowly, shard by shard.
I put it back together, though it'll always stay cracked, 
I whisper to myself to never wish for what I lacked.
I sweep up the cinders of the my hope, and live in strife, 
But this isn't a fairy tale, it's the blisters of real life.

Dreams don't fill my mind now, like the smoke filled my lung,
Young minds burn the brightest, but my mind's no longer young. 
I'm scorched by what I used to think would lead me to fruition,
I'm seared by wishful thinking, I'm scorched by ambition.

                I took off my shoes, they just didn’t seem to fit.
I took a deep breath, soon I’ll just get sick of it.
I tried having my own style, they said I looked weird,
They hit me in the face with everything I feared.
So I closed up the gates, now they can’t gatekeep,
I didn’t have it in myself to take the longest leap.

I sit down, I hug my knees, I wipe away a tear.
Why the hell do they still ask me why I’m here?
The darkness shrouds my face, just like it did my fear,
You don’t know how much this can hurt, how much it can sear.

So the closet creaks as I open its door to take a look,
I don’t want to be seen this way, my room’s now like a nook.
I see the lights I used to love, but they’re just so far away,
Is it really such a pain to accept the phrase ‘I’m gay’?
Your ‘love’ is null and void, so is your backstabbing support,
I sigh and shake my head, and I close the closet door.

I hear the whispers and the rants, I don’t know why I care,
I guess it just makes me lose hope, ever-increasingly rare.
I read about the past, I guess the future escaped my hold,
Maybe I’ll wait here ‘til this passes and grows old.
I read the comments on the ‘net, though they shouldn’t matter,
But I guess I set the bar too high, the truth will never flatter.

I’m suffocating in here, but outside kills me worse,
They’re only photophobic once the light gets to disperse.
I can’t pretend I’m someone else, it’s too much to rehearse,
And now my voice falters as I read out every verse.

So the closet creaks again as I gasp for fresh air,
And they slay me like a monster, with daggers in their stare.
I hear the voices that promised me they loved me, now they slaughter,
They loved me as their ol’ son more, they wouldn’t love their daughter.
And it’s so stupid, I don’t even know who I’m crying for,
So I sigh and shake my head, and I close the closet door.

Possibilities rush through my head, but none are that great,
I guess they’d love me more if I’d just started out straight.
I’d hate to break it to ya, it’s not something I can alter.
I guess I don’t really care if I’m not accepted at their altar.
I tried to be myself, but ‘myself’ isn’t what they want,
They’ll tell themselves it’s just a phase and act all nonchalant.

But on my last stifled breath, I released that choke-hold,
‘Cause this was never my fault, unlike what I’ve been told.
And I hope one day you realise that, but it’s not in my control,
So I’ll step out of this closet, free from its dust and mould.

The closet creaks a final time as I step into the light,
I might not shine enough for them, but it’d still be bright.
They broke my soul apart, so I’ll build it up again,
Though I guess I’ll never know if it was ever worth the pain.
So I sigh, turn around, and face that false evermore.
The closet’s now all empty, it creaks as I close the door.

But my story doesn't end here, and neither does my life, 
I've endured hardships for so long, I can still live with strife. 
This doesn't have to be the end,
I don't need to know where my life went. 
The sun has set, but I still have the moon, 
And that void might just fill itself soon.

I searched for a purpose, but none have come hurtling my way,

It doesn't have to be saddening, there's nothing left to give, 
So I'll let the void fill itself, and I'll let myself live.

Never looked in the mirror, never noticed my scars.

The sickly-sweet smog never made me nauseous.
I rushed through my troubles, but never thought they’d chase me,

Bled through my facade, but never stopped pretending, 
On second thought, this wasn't such a happy ending. 
A flurry, I hurried through smoke, unfazed,

I hear footsteps outside my door. 
Footsteps chill me to my core. 
Don't know what I hear 
There's no one here 
And now I can't go sleep anymore.. 

Footsteps, FOOTSTEPS, 'round my house, 
Is it a murderer, thief, or mouse? 
What am I hearing when does it stop? 
The tip-tap, tip-tap, clap, clap, clop.

I hear footsteps on my lawn.
I block my ears, they’re still going on. 
No matter my fright 
In the middle of the night. 
I keep bearing them, dusk or dawn.

I hear footsteps in the park.
Everyone's at home, the skies are dark. 
I look like a creep 
As I listen and weep 
It's like they don't hear these noises stark.

Footsteps, FOOTSTEPS, echo through the sky,
Is it a government agent, or spy? 
Why do I hear them? Is it just myelf? 
Tip, tap, tip, tap, please, please help.

I hear footsteps at hours late.
Even though I’ve barricaded every gate. 
There's plugs in my ears 
But the sound is still clear, 
Through my head, footsteps continue to grate

I hear footsteps, throughout my mind.
The source of the sound, I can never find. 
Medication doesn't assist 
So the source can't not exist 
And it's impossible to block away its grind. 

Footsteps, FOOTSTEPS, all around 
Can't chase them away, can't run from the sound. 
Is it an otherworldly alarm of dread? 
Tip, tap, tip, tap, I'm losing my head.

I hear footsteps, like hell's call. 
I hear footsteps in the soundproof hall.
I break down crying
Internally dying
And yet no one's there, no one's there at all.

I hear footsteps, in the wake of my tears.
I hear them still, they're harrowing fears.
They echo throughout
As I’m bleeding out
They're the last sound to ring in my ears.

Footsteps, FOOTSTEPS, six feet below. 
The fear won't die, the sound won't go. 
My ears won't hear and my eyes won't see,

Our hopes into the soil?

But I swear to you, next time you look,
OUR flag will be on that hoist.

Dear Dyer, just wait and see,

It’s a forlorn, musty haze of tragedies unforeseen.
I kneel next to the headstone, your name's still engraved, 
I wish there were more memoirs kept, more moments saved. 
It's been so long, they've forgotten you, they've all moved on, 
But I can't digest the truth that you're not coming back, you're gone.

It breaks my soul every day, but I have to pretend, 
I have to tell myself that this isn't at all the end. 
They'll kill me one day, these lies where I have to delve, 
But if I ever understand the truth, I'd probably kill myself. 
So I've continued to console myself, and choose which lies are true, 
Though every tear feels like it's washing away a part of you.

When reality finally dawns, it's just so tough to swallow, 
So I shove it back down into the misery where I wallow.
I return to the grave every day, but nothing ever changes, 
I sit on swings by myself, crying over our small exchanges. 
Every day I wipe dust off your photo, hanging in my room, 
I water flowers, step back and watch the spider lilies bloom.

Whose shoulder will I cry on now? Whose hand will I hold? 
Your warmth was ripped away from me, you left me in the cold.
Now all the laughter to my jokes is drenched with masked pity, 
All the things I used to love now make me feel more shitty.
Who will I share my joy with, when there's no more joy to share?
Please just come back down and say it's all just a nightmare.

And when the radio plays your favorite song, I burst into tears,
Over all I took for granted, all those sacred years. 
I mourn you, I mourn myself too, as I try to mend my heart, 
But I can't reverse the flow of time that tore it all apart. 
The hourglass sands shifted me into a sandstorm, 
And though that dust has settled, I still continue to mourn.

That's probably all I'll do now, for I've lost the light of day, 
If I ever start to care again, time might steal it away.
Just like it took away all of the memories I couldn't save, 
And ripped away my joy, leaving me weeping at your grave. 
So I'll stay right there beside you, amidst the mist of gloom,
And for the rest of time, I'll watch the spider lilies bloom.

                The world's joyous and merry, grass is white with snow 
Doorways are decorated with holly and mistletoe. 
I can see the winter beauty, looking out my window,
As I sit here in my room, lit up by the dimmest glow.

I bet they're so confused that I'm not socialising, 
I guess this is my way of finding life energising.
My pen moves over the paper, it's just so hypnotising.
Is is weird that I find this loneliness mesmerising?

Alone in the silence, there's in no voices interrupting,
Alone in the darkness, there's no anxiety disrupting.
Alone, there's no monsters 'neath my bed, (but me),
Alone in my room, I feel free... free... free…

They all think I'm weird, so I guess that's ‘just a quirk’, 
So for these few hours, in my room I'll lurk. 
Devoid of any chores, devoid of any work, 
And savor these moments where I don’t drive myself berserk.

The only times I'll leave is to refill my coffee mug,
For now, the only steps I'll take are barefoot on a rug. 
This is the only time I can recharge while unplugged, 
And it’s probably the last time I'll ever be this snug.

Alone with my thoughts, there's no pressure to impress, 
Alone with my mind, I can ignore all the stress. 
Alone, there's me and only me, and just myself to uplift, 
Alone in my room, I can drift... drift... drift...

                Your castles are crumbling, 
But don't dare to take cover, 
You musn't be seen stumbling, 
So just silently suffer. 
Your dignity is on the line, 
A greater woman's tougher, 
Aim for someone to call you ‘mine’.
You're just meant to be a lover.

Chin UP, back STRAIGHT, hold your head high,
Crane your neck so far, you look up at the sky.
So but don't get too high and cocky, stay “modest” and “shy”. 
Get ready to pack your life away for the next suiting guy,

Whenever you dream of justice, picture your head on a spike, 
But don't you even dare to speak up, that's not "ladylike". 

Don't let your eyes stray away 
From your husbands stead, 
Lest the masses seethe and say, 
“Off with her head!"

However many rocks are thrown at you, 
Take it all with grace, 
Devote yourself to your beau, 
Do all to save his face. 
Save all for for the husband and child, 
Every warm embrace, 
Watch these injustices pile, 
And yet, “know your place”.

Eyes OPEN, mouth SHUT, do all they say to do, 
Don't cry in front of anyone they'll think less of you. 
Men will call you the vilest things, an ‘untamed shrew’,
But don't defend yourself, keep your face shining like new.

You’ll be termed a witch for your first imperfect breath,
Or you’d be hanging on the gallows, or burned to death.
Accused of infidelity, despite all that you'd said,
'Cause all they'll ever shoot back with is 'Off with her head!'
They never got a chance to see what all you could do,
But maybe, in the far future, they’ll write poems about you.

                The walls are chipped, the floors are scratched, 
They just sent in another batch.
I'm hearing screams, and cries of pain, 
But that's normal here, we're all insane. 
Except one, kneeling by the door, 
Rambling about outliving the war.

“They need to see the truth”, he says 
“It's tortured us all for these days.” 
“They need to hear me out”, he pleads,
“To know of all their awful deeds.”
“I’ll endure through all that's in store," 
"If it means I'll outlive the war."

Every now and then, we're let outside, 
But on the border-fence, so many have died. 
Now and then, the grass is dyed red, 
Reminiscent of the flag overhead. 
They tell us this is what we deserve, 
For all our gluttonous sins - "the nerve!”

And those of us who've led astray
Are taken to chambers far away.
When he hears disinfection', he'll wince,
For we've never seen those sinners since.
And yet, despite it all, he swore,
"I'll do it, I'll outlive the war."

His wife was deemed an imperfect birther, 
Her face was scorched, displayed, then murdered. 
In their words, it’s a just death sentence, 
Yet still he weeps and promises vengeance. 
His burning hope is our source of light, 
But deep down, we know we won't win this fight.

He's written books with painstaking effort, 
To "undo the damage they've done, forever." 
He wants to rescue every Jew, 
For atter all, "we're human too”. 
He's braced through brutality, braced through gore, 
Saying, “I'll help us all outlive the war."

They say Jews are drunk with greed, but he's sober, 
He's given us faith, the war's almost over. 
They’re burning evidence, to take us down as they fall, 
But he'll declare the truth, he’ll save us all. 
And now, it's not just him who's livid, 
We'll brace through the war, we'll all outlive it.

...

I write this verse in the midst of carnage. 
They've deemed us all collateral damage. 
He fought as they dragged him to his death, 
I heard his screams, heard his last breath 
And now I... I won't stand for this anymore!! 
I'll... I swear I'll outl--

One glance into the hazy sky, 
And I got lost again.
My joy shone in the morning light, 
Then vanished with the rain.

I wonder what I did to deserve this hell, 
But I can only really wonder, 
What's the need to brace through pain, and dwell,
Until it pulls you under?

In this world, it's kill or die, 
In this world, it's scream or cry. 
In this world, get fooled or lie,
In here, there's no answer to 'why’. 

In this world, it's hit and bust, 
In this world, it's hide or trust. 
In this world, you'd better fear the worst, 
Kill it or it’ll kill you first. 

In this world, you've no choice but to run, 
Flee from the bullets, or steal the gun. 
Try all you want, but once it's done, 
You'll either lose, or regret having won. 

Stay shallow, or go to the high-dive, 
That's the rules to the game of life. 
So go ahead, and roll the dice,
But remember - there's no second tries.

You don't choose your role, 
But you choose your goal, 
Best of luck, bless your soul, 
You don't get to reroll.

One glance into the hazy sky, 
And it clouds my vision, 
It gets hazier with every sigh, 
Are there no right decisions?

Bracing for impact in battle-stance, 
Luck led me astray, 
Long since I lost the game of chance, 
But who wins it anyway?

Walking in the most fitting shoes,
Walking straight towards the noose. 
All sense of choice is just a ruse, 
Life's not kind enough to let you choose. 

How can you tell between lies and truths, 
When life doesn't give you any clues?
Can't navigate through the haze to find an excuse, 
I sealed my fate, I'm destined to lose.

In this world, you have no say,
In the game of life, you'll have to play. 
In this world, it's flee or stay,
But you'll regret it either way. 

In this world, it's drown or burn, 
In this world, move on or mourn,
In this world, it's spend or earn, 
In this world, it's teach and learn.

In this world, it's love or hate,
In this world, there's no blank slates. 
In this world, it’s up to fate.
In this world, the path's already paved.

In this world, it's hate or hate, 
Don't fall for love's decietful bait.
In this world, there's no escape,
You can't run now, it's just too late.

In this world, it's KILL or DIE, 
Don't waste time trying to fix your life. 
You did it once, rolled the dice,
But remember, there's no second tries.

Can't choose your role 
When you're in fate's hold. 
Curse your luck, you poor soul,
Now you don’t get to reroll.

Unreciprocation haunts the hints of my love,
Trapped inside the fences I put up to prove I’m tough.
I tried to melt your coldness to quench my deadly thirst, 
But perhaps the fences blocked you out, the cold got to me first.

So I tried to open up to you, but you tore down my fences,
Turned them into firewood to fuel your false pretenses.
Burnt down vulnerabilities I wish I'd set in stone, 
Now you warm your hands by the fire, while I'm freezing and alone.

Maybe my warmth burnt you, so your temperament got harsher, 
But how long will I be the scapegoat to your archer?

The amber eyes I used to love, now tinged with azure hues, 
They used to reassure me, now they make me confused.
Confused about the warmth I now only feel in your ghost, 
Confused as to where you were when I needed you most.

We've both been through wars, I've always tried to be your shield,
I know you've still got bruises that never truly healed. 
I’ll try my best to tend to your wounds, and disregard mine, 
All I ask is for you to please just give me a sign.

I'll brace through like a soldier, I'll be a fearless marcher, 
But how long will I be the scapegoat to your archer?

They tell me to run while I can, but I hold out hope, 
Maybe it's delusion, maybe I do it to cope. 
I’d break my back to bear the brunt of your bashful sins. 
But I can't crack your cold exterior, please just let me in.

You stranded me in twisting walls of mental labyrinths, 
Some say you poisoned my glass panes with rose-colored tints.
Same say it's manipulation, some say it's neglect, 
And everyone tells me that my pleas have no effect.

I don't want to believe them, but the fissure's growing larger, 
How long will I be the scapegoat to your archer?

The hazel eyes I used to have, now tinged with dead grey hues, 
They say I'm losing myself to all of your abuse. 
Sometimes I dream of leaving before it gets too late, 
Because you never thought your weak little scapegoat would escape.

But as I walk to freedom - and this time on my own, 
I hear your voice begging me to not leave you alone. 
It takes all of me not to turn back and comfort you, 
But then I'm pulled back by the part of me that just can't hurt you.

I force away my tears, shove back my hopes of departure, 
And turn back to you, the scapegoat to my archer.

I search for an exit 
And then ambition wrecks it, 
Tunnel vision on imperfections obscures my gaze. 
I'm almost hyperventilating

Where did I end up now?
What? When? Where? Why? How?

Crossroads obfuscated
I just can't tolerate it 
I've reached the point where all of this is too much to bear. 
The paths keep on diverging
There once were others searching, 
But unlike me, they found their way out, and it's so unfair.

I used to fear the footsteps, felt like I was being followed, 
But now that they are gone, the isolation feels more hollow. 
Everyone has moved on; I want to move on too,

My hands were bruised, my knees were grazed, 
But I trudged through the field, unhurt, unfazed,
...or so it seemed.

Oh, but that's not quite right, 
Behind my facade, I was losing my fight, 
Scorching days, and sleepless nights, 
It must be a bad dream.

But I know it'll be alright, 
The grass must be greener on the other side,
I'll brace through the dark, and when I find the light, 
The grass will be green.

I feel like my destination's near,
The field is cold, but the dread still sears, 
I try to cling to something that will calm my fears, 
A pillar on which to lean.

Though truth is blunt, it stabs like a spear, 
But the grass must be greener far away from here, 
But blind faith doesn't make that the path crystal clear,
It's my tears that are crystalline.

One time, I read in cryptic proses, 
That the fruit's harvested by the one who grows it,
That one by the should always stop and smell roses,
I'm still not sure what that means.

But my effort'll pay off; the way the saying goes is, 
The one who reaps the one who sows it.
The search is rough, but I'm the one who chose it, 
Somewhere, the grass must be green.
...

Oh, blind faith skybound, 
My hopes were so high, I lost sight of the ground, 
In search of greater things that I'd never found, 
Things I'd never even seen. 

So when I faltered and hit the ground, 
For the first time, when I looked down, 
There, in the very same field, all around, 
The grass was green.

Sturdy like a stone statue, easily turned to dust,

Towering heights of strength that easily collapse.
Vivid like works of art, that slowly fade to black.

It’s only when they’re frozen that their truth becomes clear,

For glass is see-through,
Though now indestructible, yet shaped like a tear.

Wading through the tides of perfectionist strokes,
Facades of durability further obscured by beauty’s cloaks.
Susceptible to stains
Surfaces easy to taint,
What happens when you realise that that beauty is a hoax?

One touch to the tapers, and all the beauty shatters,
Thus the fabled indestructibility ceases to matter.
If you touch its pretty shards,
It’s you who gets scarred,
And in the end, it will only be your blood that will spatter.

Cracks never mended and wounds never healed,
There’s no such thing as an undauntable shield.

You know your essence symbolises the end of life,

You may be the end of life, but you're why it's progressing.

You haunt the future so that we appreciate the present,
You might portray darkness, but deep down you're iridescent.
Did you know life's beauty shines on the very verge of death?
Mortals pray for loved ones right before they lose their breath.
I used to think you drag me down, but really you guide me on,
Some see you as the dusk of life, when really you're the dawn.

You add that thrill to life that only some realise we need,
You're that part of living that makes mortals pay heed.
You're the pearls with which the sea of life is decorated,
You're more than that impending doom all the world once .
You might've already known this, but if not, now you know,

And now I'm running away, for I’m scared of consequence.

But my moral compass keeps pointing back toward south, 
My tongue feels like it’s glued to the roof of my mouth. 
So I can't defend myself, even if they'll hear me out.

Forgiveness is deadly, for you’ll lose sight of all your wrecks,
Trust is deadly, for then there's no one to keep you in check. 
Ambition’s deadly, it'll be the straw that snaps my neck.

I don't like choosing between intuition and lessons I've learned, 
I don't like putting on this mask of concern.
I don't like how I've got blisters from the bridges I’ve burned.

I don't like being haunted by the fears I thought I drowned, 
I don't like the fragility of my pretty glass crown.
I don't like this sense of guilt, it's only weighing me down.

I don't like how the roots of my past cause me to trip, 
I'm the one holding the dagger, but it's like I'm losing my grip. 
Yet it no longer hurts when I'm stabbed by its tip.

Hope is deadly when it turns to blind optimism, 
Selflessness is deadly when it turns to masochism. 
Guilt is deadly, it tells me that it's my fault when it isn't!

The bullets are deadly, but I'm the one holding the gun,
Realisation's deadly, it tears apart the webs of lies I've spun.
I don't like when it hits me... what if I'm the deadly one?
